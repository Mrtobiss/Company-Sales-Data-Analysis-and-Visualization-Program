# Company-Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Program
This program analyzes company sales data and generates visualizations to help understand sales trends.

Program Description:

This program is a data analysis and visualization tool designed to help companies understand their sales trends and patterns. It takes in company sales data from a CSV file and generates two visualizations: a line plot of total profit over months and a subplot of bathing soap and facewash sales over months.

The program uses the pandas library to read and manipulate the data, and matplotlib to create the visualizations. The total profit plot provides an overview of the company's sales performance over time, while the subplot allows for a more detailed comparison of the sales trends for two specific products, bathing soap and facewash.

This program can be used by businesses to:

- Analyze sales data and identify trends and patterns
- Visualize sales performance over time
- Compare sales of different products
- Make informed decisions about product development and marketing strategies

Input: Company sales data in a CSV file

Output: Two visualizations: a line plot of total profit over months and a subplot of bathing soap and facewash sales over months.
